## Overview

The app is meant to track the date, type of workout, and duration of your workout routine depending on the timeline you set for yourself when exercising.

### The project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app relative to their device's screen size - desktop, tablet, and mobile alike. Convenient use across multiple platforms.
- Select the date, type of workout on schedule, and the duration of the workout on a given day using the "add entry button"
- Erase any pre-recorded workout using the "clear row" button labeled with an "x" on the right side of the table. Said button will clear all fields in anticipation of re-populating the fields according to one's preference
- Review their workout routine at the end of the day, week, or month according to the schedules they set forth themselves.

### My Process

I applied the basic Responsive Web Design practices by creating a table with the respective headers, rows, inputs, and buttons using HTML, updated their visual appearance with simple CSS styling, and applied some JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques to bring life to the DOM and manipulate the JavaScript aspect of the app through the browser console.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to implement some practical DOM Manipulation logic, using methods, functions, arrays and objects to achieve full functionality on my web application with minimal errors. How to use click and change event listeners under specific circumstances like when there is a change on one specific object, you apply a function to ensure that certain fields are updated.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practices to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including but not limited to DOM Manipulation, object oriented programming principles, and event handlers.
I will also further my understanding of using the root element and the significance of JavaScript classes.
